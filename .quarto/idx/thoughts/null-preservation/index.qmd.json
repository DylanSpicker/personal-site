So instance, if one is considering the null of no causal influece of treatment ($a$) on an outcome ($Y$), then the standard quadratic regression $$E[Y|A=a] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1a + \\beta_2a^2$$ is correctly specified when there is no causal effect [e.g. it is some constant] even if the mean structure between Y and A is incorrect (supposing it exists).\n\nThis is a neat concept in part because it means that a conclusion in which we reject the null is valid evidence against the null, regardless of whether or model is correctly specified. If we take a conservative statisticians point-of-view, and never claim evidence in favour of the alternative, then null preservation permits us to draw valid conclusions, even when model mis-specification is all but certain.
