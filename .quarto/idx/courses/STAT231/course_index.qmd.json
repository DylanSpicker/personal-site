This weeks tutorial breaks the format that I set out last week (oops!) because I did not want to overwhelm. My solutions to the problems (see attached pdf file!) ended up running long, and so I figured I would save you sitting through the recap/look forward/thinking statistically sections of this video [I had a \"magic trick\" filmed to explain likelihood, which, if time permits later in the course, I can certainly share (see the attached picture if you want a spoiler!)]. I know that the longer tutorial may feel like additional stress, and so I want to make three things with this clear: (1) I have tried to include as many steps in the solution as I could to provide a very thorough background on the problem. I have tried to talk slow, and not skip details, and so hopefully the longer video is explained by this; (2) I wanted to provide more example problems, particularly this week covering MLE, since they are the first \"mathematical topic\" we are covering. If you feel very comfortable with them, and you take a look at the questions and feel okay with those, feel free to skim the video -- you can certainly do well in this course without it. (3) I will make it up to you with a shorter video on a topic that warrants it! I wanted to remind you all that if you have any questions regarding the content in the tutorials, you can always reach me by email (dylan.spicker@uwaterloo.ca) or on Piazza, and if you have any feedback at all, please feel free to reach out. Ultimately, it is my hope to try to use the tutorials to form some of \"in-class\" relationship that we are missing out on, being online, and if there is anyway I can improve that for you, please let me know! Thanks, and I hope you all have an excellent weekend and week!\n1.
